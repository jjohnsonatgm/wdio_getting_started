# wdio_getting_started

## Background
The purpose of this minimal repo is to help teach Junior TAE's, GM new hires, or Globant TAE's how to use WebDriverIO. To do this effectively, this repo has been broken into multiple parts:
- interactions
- selector-strategies
- pom
- playground
- utility

### Interactions
The purpose of this part is to show off basic page interactions

Currently, as of 08/17/2023, the provided sections are:
- click
- waitFor

### Selector Strategies
The purpose of this part is to show off various selector strategies that are used at Great Minds. This is more-so a collaborative section that should be built out over time when new strategies are figured out

Currently, as of 08/17/2023, the provided sections are:
- attribute
- similar elements

### Playground
The purpose of this part is to provide practice TC's that SIT TAE's have to automate on a daily basis. The list below gets progressively more difficult and lengthy. Order below is easiest -> most difficult.

Currently, as of 08/17/2023, the provided practice TC's are:
- login
- dropdowns
- navigate to planning
- Manage, create teacher and login for the first time
- assign assessment as a teacher
- complete assessment as a student
- navigate through explore -> planning, assign multiple resources and launch an assignment
- create assignment through assign
- launch a livemode presentation

### Utilities
The purpose of this part is more so to provide useful functions that we use everyday on the SIT pod.

## Where you should start
It all depends on how you feel you learn best. 

- Do you learn the best by looking at code that is already put together? Then start with interactions or selector-strategies
- Do you learn the best by practicing code? Then start with the playground exercises and go from there
